# Kode Radar

Kode Radar is a lightweight Flutter application for tracking repositories hosted on GitHub and Azure DevOps. A core design principal for Kode Radar is that all user secrets are stored locally on all platforms. This is to ensure the application is safe to use for both personal and enterprise use cases. Kode Radar does not have any backend service and doesn't do any tracking.

The repository contains multiplatform targets currently supporting:

* Android
* iOS
* macOS
* Linux
* Windows

This project has been verified to build and run for the following targets:

- [ ] Android
- [ ] iOS
- [x] macOS
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] Windows

Note: This project has been almost entirely AI generated. I don't recommend using the project as a model for code style, Flutter architecture/design or best practices.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (compatible version for this project)
- Platform toolchains for the targets you are building (Android SDK/NDK, Xcode for iOS/macOS, CMake for Linux, Visual Studio for Windows)

---

## Configurable build properties

To remove hardcoded identifiers from the source tree, all platforms read a couple of important build configuration settings from environment variables:

- **APP_BUNDLE_ID** - The application/bundle identifier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.kode_radar`)
- **APP_COMPANY** - Company name used in copyright notices (e.g., `YourCompany`)

These values have sensible defaults (`com.example.*`) that do not contain any organization-specific strings. You should override them locally or in CI with values appropriate for your organization.

## How to build

**All platforms**

Set environment variables before building:

```bash
export APP_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourcompany.kode_radar
export APP_COMPANY=YourCompany
```

Then build for your target platform:

```bash
flutter build apk --release          # Android APK
flutter build appbundle --release    # Android App Bundle  
flutter build ios --release          # iOS
flutter build macos --release        # macOS
flutter build linux --release        # Linux
flutter build windows --release      # Windows
```

**Per-machine setup (recommended)**

Add the exports to your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc) for permanent local configuration:

```bash
echo 'export APP_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourcompany.kode_radar' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export APP_COMPANY=YourCompany' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows PowerShell**

For Windows, use PowerShell to set environment variables:

```powershell
$env:APP_BUNDLE_ID = "com.yourcompany.kode_radar"
$env:APP_COMPANY = "YourCompany"
flutter build windows --release
```

**CI / automated builds**

In CI (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) set these values as environment variables or secrets:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Build releases
  env:
    APP_BUNDLE_ID: ${{ secrets.APP_BUNDLE_ID }}
    APP_COMPANY: ${{ secrets.APP_COMPANY }}
  run: |
    flutter build apk --release
    flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

Store any sensitive values (API tokens, signing keys) in the CI provider's encrypted secrets store â€” never commit them to the repository, even in your personal branches.

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

This repository includes comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and pull request validation.

### PR Validation Workflow

The `pr-validation.yml` workflow automatically runs on all pull requests and includes:

#### Code Quality Checks
- **Dart/Flutter formatting validation** - Ensures consistent code style
- **Static analysis** - Runs `flutter analyze --fatal-infos` to catch potential issues
- **Unit tests** - Executes all tests with coverage reporting
- **Coverage reporting** - Uploads coverage data to Codecov (optional)

#### Multi-Platform Builds
All supported platforms are built automatically to ensure compatibility:

- **Android** - Builds both APK and App Bundle formats
- **iOS** - Builds without code signing for CI validation
- **macOS** - Desktop application build
- **Linux** - Desktop application build with GTK dependencies
- **Windows** - Desktop application build

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Dependency caching** - Caches Flutter pub dependencies and platform-specific build tools
- **Parallel execution** - All platform builds run concurrently after code quality checks pass
- **Artifact uploads** - Build outputs are uploaded for review and testing

### Branch Protection

To enforce PR validation, configure branch protection rules for the `main` branch:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Branches** in your GitHub repository
2. Add a branch protection rule for `main`
3. Require the following status checks:
   - `Code Quality Checks`
   - `Build Android`
   - `Build iOS`
   - `Build macOS`
   - `Build Linux`
   - `Build Windows`

See [.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

### Environment Variables

The CI workflow uses the same configurable build properties as local builds:

- **APP_BUNDLE_ID** - Application/bundle identifier
- **APP_COMPANY** - Company name for copyright notices

Default values are provided for CI, but you can override them using GitHub Secrets for organization-specific builds.
